# This is a level 1 header

## R Markdown

### This is a level 3 header

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

## Insert table

```{r}
knitr::kable(head(cars),
             caption = "Top 6")
```

## Insert an equation

$$ Y = \beta_0 + \beta_1x$$

## Insert an image
